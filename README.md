This repository contains my solutions to **Codeforces** programming problems, primarily implemented in **Python**.  
The goal of this repo is to **practice competitive programming**, improve **problem-solving skills**, and build a **reusable reference** for algorithms and techniques.

## ðŸ“‚ Repository Structure  


- `A-Div2/`, `B-Div2/` etc. â†’ Problems solved from different **difficulty divisions**  
- `Contests/` â†’ Solutions organized by **contest ID**  
- Each file is named by the **problem code** (e.g., `1234A.py` â†’ Problem A from contest 1234).

## âš¡ How to Run  

1. Clone the repo  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/Codeforces-Solutions.git
   cd Codeforces-Solutions

ðŸ‘‰ Just replace `<your-username>` with your actual GitHub username so the badges and stats work correctly.  

Do you also want me to include a **Codeforces handle badge** that links directly to your Codeforces profile?
